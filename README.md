Hello!

This project is my personal portfolio.

If you are reading this you are probably interested in my capabilities as a frontend web developer.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with vanilla:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

## Note
This project was made as a part of the Codecademy frontend engineering course.

https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path

It is *intended* to be made without frameworks/libraries utilizing only vanilla coding.

This README is also part of learning and was made in order to follow best practices in relation to Git and GitHub.

Thank you for reading.
